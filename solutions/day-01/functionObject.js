// Create a function called getPersonInfo. The getPersonInfo function takes an object parameter. The structure of the object and the output of the function is given below. Try to use both a regular way and destructuring and compare the cleanness of the code. If you want to compare your solution with my solution, check this link.

const person = {
  firstName: "Asabeneh",
  lastName: "Yetayeh",
  age: 250,
  country: "Finland",
  job: "Instructor and Developer",
  skills: [
    "HTML",

    "Node",
    "MongoDB",
    "Python",
    "D3.js",
  ],
  languages: ["Amharic", "English", "Suomi(Finnish)"],
};

function getPersonInfo(obj) {
  const { firstName, lastName, age, country, job, skills, languages } = obj;
  console.log(
    `${firstName} ${lastName} lives in ${country}. He is ${age} years old. He is an ${job}. He learns ${skills} and speaks ${languages}.`
  );
}
console.log(getPersonInfo(person));
